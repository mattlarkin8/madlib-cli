# **LAB - Class 03**

## **Project: Madlib**

### **Author: Matthew Larkin**

### **Setup**

Run the program using `python madlib_cli/madlib.py`.

#### Tests

The tests can be run with `python -m pytest`. The most important test is for `parse_template` since that function is the most complex.

### **Credit**

I worked with Justin Hamerly to create the `parse_template` function. I also worked with Alec Torres on the `parse_template` function as well as the the program functionality to take user input and implement all of the functions we created.
